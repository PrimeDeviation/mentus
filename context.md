# Mentus Progress Tracker

The `context.md` file maintains a history of tasks completed and tracks the current objective. It ensures that the state of the project is always clear and up-to-date, enabling any developer or process to quickly get up to speed with the project's progress.

## Purpose
This file serves as a living record of the project's progress. It is essential that this file is never overwritten or deleted. Instead, updates should always be appended to ensure that the full history of the project's progress is maintained.

## Process for Updating
1. **Start of a Work Session**:
   - At the beginning of each work session, check the `context.md` file to determine the current state of the project.
   - Review the most recent update to understand what the last completed task was and what the current objective is.

2. **During a Work Session**:
   - As tasks are completed, append a summary of each task to the end of the file.
   - If a task needs to be retried, update the relevant summary line with a suffix indicating the number of attempts (e.g., "Task 1 - Attempt 2").
   - If the task is successfully completed after retrying, update the task summary to indicate its successful completion, including the number of attempts.

## Current Objective
Initializing the `context.md` file and providing detailed instructions for its maintenance.
### Task 2
- Cleaned and verified the content of README.md by removing extraneous lines. Used Python for writing multi-line content to avoid shell-related issues.
