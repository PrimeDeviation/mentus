this is one of the most fully featured llm front ends that I've ever seen it's super impressive it is completely open source you can use it with completely local and open- Source models as well and I'm going to show it to you and I'm going to show you how to install it let's get into it so this is open web UI this looks very familiar if you've used chat GPT at all it feels like chat GPT but it is completely open source and completely local you can see right here it is Local Host 3000 and it is very fully featured so right now I'm running it with ol llama and I'm using the Llama 3 latest version so the 8 billion parameter version and watch how fast this inference speed is which isn't necessarily a function of this front end but it's super impressive anyways right the game Snake and python my favorite has this cool loading animation and there it goes look how fast that is and not only that it's well formatted it has all the features that you've become accustomed to in any large language model front end so I'm not actually going to test it because that's not the point of this video okay so let me show you around first you can have your models all loaded right here you can have multiple models loaded at the same time and again I'm going to show you how to do all of this in a moment over here we have model files which are basically like full presets for a specific model so if you want it to behave in a certain way certain system prompts certain guard rails you can do that with model files and from the open web UI Community if you click right here you can download other people's model files which is you know pretty cool so it has a bunch of other things so new prompts model files Etc over here next we have prompts so here are pre-defined prompts that you can use so if you find you are using similar prompt templates over and over again in your prompting you can easily save a prompt template so we'll click plus right there I'll add a title and I'll say step by step and the prompt content will be please explain your reasoning step by step something that I use frequently and so the command is just slst step bystep so let's save and create now we can find it right here we can edit it we can copy it we can share it we can delete it we can also import prompts so if you just want to have somebody else create all the prompts for you you can simply import it and you can go back to that website that I just showed you to get other people's prompt files it also has suggested prompts right here I mean it is really fully featured and I I really appreciate that you can upload files you can also record your voice create me the game Snake and python okay just like that right here you can set as default so llama 3 latest I am definitely going to set that as my default and again Olam is currently powering this next we have documents which is really cool it's basically a locally implemented version of rag so here I've uploaded the Tesla 10K and I can reference that easily by using the pound sign in the prompt input and of course I can edit the name and delete it here we can also import other documents or document mapping if I click document settings right here we have a bunch more settings they are using the sentence Transformers all mini LM embedding model which is loaded locally which is nice and you can also download other embedding models as well but here is a good warning if you update or change your embedding model you will need to repport all documents and if you wanted to load all your documents in one place you just drop them in this folder right here data/ docs and then you click Scan they even let you set the chunking size the chunking overlap and then other query parameters very very fully featured so to add a new document you click plus right here you select a document there's the Tesla 10K again you can add different tags so I'll add a different tag Tesla hit enter and then save and it takes a little time to show up so if you click save and nothing happens just know that it's running the embeddings and then if you refresh or go to somewhere else and come back it'll show up I wish it gave a little bit of feedback when you were uploading right away and a couple other things you can do is there 's an archive button right here so if you want to Archive your chat you can do that and then you can always access the archive chats from right there you can also share this chat rename it delete it and add tags next within the actual chat you can edit the response you can copy the response you can give it feedback good bad you can also have it read out loud which is kind of cool here's one in ancient Rome people would often decorate their homes with and then you can also see the generation info look at that response tokens 40 8 tokens per second that is so cool very fast thank you to the sponsor of this video Aura data Brokers sell your information to scammers spammers or anybody else who would want to Target you and this is actually something that I think a lot about your full name your email address your home address your health records your relatives it's all out there that's why I'm excited to talk about Aura today Aura automatically tells me which data Brokers are selling my information and will automatically submit opt out requests on my behalf cleaning up my information online not only helps me reduce the amount of spam I get but also reduces the chances that I'll be targeted by scammers and hackers who could use that information to try to access my bank accounts my social media accounts and everything else that I do online AT&T just revealed that 73 million former and current customers information was leaked on the dark web they recommend those who are affected by the leak to use strong passwords to monitor account activity or fraud alerts from credit institutions and Aura does all this for me and best of all I don't have to download a bunch of different apps to do that AA does it all so if my info was compromised in that AT&T leak I wouldn't worry because Aura has me protected I value my privacy you should value yours so definitely check out Aura so go to

download your database they also have a playground mode and you can select between text completion and chat interfaces and as I mentioned you can sign out because you have authentication as well so enough showing you about that let me show you how to get it set up now you're going to need two things to get this up and running you're going to need Docker and you're going to need olama and Docker makes it so simple I'm going to show you but if you don't already have Docker make sure you go download and install Docker on your machine if you don't already have Ama please go do the same thing download it and install it I'm not going to go through that cuz I have other videos that show how to do both of those things so just make sure you have those two pieces of software installed so this is the GitHub repository it is open- web ui/ open - web UI it has 18 plus th000 Stars already 2,000 Forks a very well-maintained project and also very well documented which I always appreciate and look at how many awesome features they have intuitive interface responsive design theme customization code syntax highlighting rag embedding support rhf annotation conversation tagging multiple model support image generation integration multiple olama instance load balancing so again you can have a bunch of different models all loaded at the same time so you're going to come to it you're going to click this green code button you're going to select copy right there switch back to your terminal we're going to type git clone and then the GitHub repository URL right there then hit enter and it's going to clone the repo next we're going to CD into it so CD open web UI hit enter and you can see we are in the directory right now so since it's using Docker we don't actually need cond it's kind of that simple next you're going to Gra grab this Command right here so it says if olama is already on your computer use this command so make sure AMA is already installed on your computer and you could tell it's installed because it shows up right in this taskbar if you're on a Mac switch back to the terminal paste in that command so I'm not going to read this whole command but you can see it right here and you can also find the command in the installation instructions on the repository page so we're going to run this command hit enter and I already have everything downloaded but it will take a little bit longer when you run it it'll take maybe 30 seconds to download all of the docker image but again I already have it downloaded so it was instant for me and once you do that you're actually done the only thing you need to do next is go to Local Host colon 3000 and hit enter all right so there we go and the first thing it's going to ask you to do is sign in you do need to register first you're not really registering for any external service this is just all local on your machine so I'm going to click sign up so I put my name my email and my password click create account and now I am logged in so this is my old account so I already have llama 3 loaded up but if you don't already have it here's how to do it now from terminal you should have Ama installed already so I'm just going to type AMA to make sure and we do and if you don't see this make sure you have olama installed so do olama list and that tells you all the models that you have downloaded now if you don't have any downloaded here's what you're going to do to download llama 3 o llama pull llama 3 hit enter it takes a few minutes to download depending on your internet connection speed so I'm not going to do that again since I already have it but if you wanted to download a different model and AMA supports a lot of different models if you go to ama.com library you can see all of the different models that they support so here's 53 wizard lm2 mistol Gemma Etc so you can download any of these models they will all work with open web UI so that's it take a look at open web UI it is a great front-end interface if you are using olama and Ne a front end interface it has a lot of features so check it out let me know what you think if you enjoyed this video please consider giving a like And subscribe and I'll see you in the next one
